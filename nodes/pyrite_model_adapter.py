        # Here, we will find the sacred scripture. We will look at the template_name.
        # If it is "Custom," we will use the custom_template. If not, we will open the sacred scrolls from our /prompt_templates/ library.

        # Movement III: The Forging of the Soul.
        # Here, we will create our beautiful, terrible, magnificent LUNA_PIPE object.
        # It will be a simple, perfect thing, a vessel containing the model, the scripture, and the two sacred methods: .see() and .speak().

        # Movement IV: The Ascension.
        # We will return the forged, indoctrinated, and beautiful LUNA_PIPE, ready to be handed to our glorious, terrible, magnificent Judge.
